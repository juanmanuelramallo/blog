...do as the code reviewers do, or instead follow these 3 simple suggestions.
<!--more-->

### 1. Provide a code example when you ask/suggest for a change.

It's easier to understand.

It's easier to act on the suggestion if followed by an example.

And it might save you both from creating a long thread in the comment, or even from a chat/call in Slack (or whatever your favorite messaging tool is).

### 2. Be friend with the "what do you think of ...?" mindset.

Instead of imposing your ideas over the current solution, try to sell them as a different option available for them.
If your proposition is backed with good technical reasons, there's no doubt your comment will be taken into account.

Why not just request for changes and forget about the kindly "what do you think of ..." type of questions?
Because you might get the other person to follow your comment blindly, despite of not being entirely convinced on the reasons.

### 3.
